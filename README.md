# Prison Management System
## System Overview
The Prison Management System is an integrated information management system for correctional facilities. It was ideated from the thought that there is no thorough system that captures the real essence of a criminal sentence period in jail. Our website is simple and suffices as it concentrates on essential features like prisoner, criminal records, jailor, officer, section, etc.

Many correctional facilities do not have proper systems to cater to the vast magnitudes of requirements of criminals, and rely on manual management of critical data. Therefore, our system automates the management of critical data, reduces the likelihood of errors in manual entry, and provides reliable, timely, and accurate information to those who need it.

## Objective & Motivation
The main objective of our Prison Management System is to forge an easy-to-use and intuitive data aggregation system where all of the required needs and information are met for prisoners, and requests are automatically scaled and fulfilled according to the population of criminals. Our system is designed to have real-time access where updating any part of the database should mean the required change happens in the other parts of the system.

Our motivation for the Prison Management System is to ensure a computerized organization management system that replaces the current manual management systems used to monitor the data of prisoners. Our system ensures that the management task is eased and its performance, security, efficiency, and effectiveness are catered to. We are looking to create and design a system that has appropriate methodology, strategy, easy-to-understand, and easy-to-use, thus giving the people in charge of managing the criminals an opportunity to look at better results and reduce unnecessary overhead costs.

## Applications
The Prison Management System can be utilized in other areas such as law enforcement agencies, courts, and other correctional facilities. Our system is a collection of register cases for each prisoner entering the prison for an automated release diary generator. In developed countries of the world, people are already fighting on how prisoners can gain access to the internet in their cell room or their common room, and our system can be integrated with such advancements in the future.

## Installation and Usage
      Install XAMPP: Download and install XAMPP from the Apache Friends website. XAMPP is a package that includes Apache, PHP, and MySQL.

      Clone the repository in htdocs: Create a new directory in the htdocs folder in the XAMPP installation directory. This directory will be used to store your PHP project files.

      Create a new database: Open phpMyAdmin in your browser and create a new database that will be used by your PHP project, name of your db should be "prisondb"

      Edit configuration files: Open the "php.ini" file and make sure that the "display_errors" setting is turned on, as this will allow you to see any errors that occur while running your PHP code.

      Start Apache and MySQL: Start Apache and MySQL using the XAMPP Control Panel.

## Conclusion
Our Prison Management System is a step towards modernizing the management of criminals in correctional facilities. By automating the management of critical data, our system will help to reduce errors, increase efficiency, and provide reliable information to those who need it. Our system is easy to use, secure, and can be integrated with other advancements in the future.
