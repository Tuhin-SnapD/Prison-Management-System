# Prison-Management-System

## System Overview:

Our Project ‘Prison Management System’ was ideated from the thought that there is no thorough
system that captures the real essence of a criminal sentence period in jail, thus we have kept our
website simple and suffice as it concentrates on the essential features like Prisoner, criminal
records, Jailor, Officer, Section etc..and many correctional facilities do not have proper systems to
cater to the vast magnitudes of requirements of criminals, and rely on manual management of
critical data.

## Objective & Motivation:

The Main Objective of our Prison Management is to forge an integrated information management
system for criminals where all of the required needs and information are met through easy-to-use
and intuitive data aggregation, where requests are automatically scaled and fulfilled according to
the population of criminals, and their profiles are easily generated and
archived. We also look to have real time access where updating to any part of the database, should
mean the required change should happen in the other parts of the system.
The Motivation for the Prison Management System is that we want to ensure a computerized
organization management system that replaces the current manual management systems used to
monitor the data of prisoners, and ensures that the management task is eased and its performance,
security, efficiency and effectiveness is also catered to. We are looking to create
and design a system that has appropriate methodology, strategy, easy-to-understand and
easy-to-use, thus giving the people in charge of managing the criminals an opportunity to look at
better results and reduce unnecessary overhead costs.
